What is simon says game?
In this game, the player is challenged to remember and replicate an increasing sequence of colors.

Gameplay:
    1.Game Setup: The game typically has four colored buttons(e.g., red, green, blue, and yellow).

    2.Simon’s Turn: The game starts with the computer lighting up one of the buttons when we press any key on keyboard.

    3.Player’s Turn: After Simon's sequence is shown, the player must repeat the same sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.

    4.Increasing Difficulty: After each correct response, the game adds another Level to the sequence, making it harder as the player progresses. The sequence always begins with the same first step but gets longer as the game continues.

    5.Losing Condition: If the player clicks the wrong button or enters the wrong sequence, they lose, and the game ends , display score and restarts automatically.
